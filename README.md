# Predictive Modeling using Azure Machine Learning 

## Introduction 
In this project, I used various Azure services/resources to predict the likelihood of readmissions in diabetic patients. I was able to create visualizations of data to analyze correlation between values in a dataset 

## The Data 
I used a dataset of medical history of diabetic patients compiled by a medical research team at VCU. This dataset was then uploaded to my Azure Blob storage account in csv format. The storage account was then mounted to my databricks notebook for analysis.
